# LSP To-Go

Microsoft VSCode LSPs packaged as (unofficial) standalone npm packages:

- `lsp-togo-css`
- `lsp-togo-eslint`
- `lsp-togo-html`
- `lsp-togo-json`
- `lsp-togo-markdown`

## Why?

Microsoft has made some great LSP (Language Server Protocol) tools for VSCode. Saldy Microsoft has chosen to provide them only as part of VSCode or VSCode Extensions and not as a standalone package. Luckily many other editors (Zed, Neovim, Helix) have LSP support and so we just need to create standalone packages for each.
